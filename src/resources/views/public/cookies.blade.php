        <p>1.1 Our website uses cookies.</p>
        <p>1.2 By using our website and agreeing to this policy, you consent to our use of cookies in accordance with
            the terms of this policy.</p>

            <li><strong>About cookies</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>2.1 A cookie is a file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web
            server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each
            time the browser requests a page from the server.</p>
        <p>2.2 Cookies may be either "persistent" cookies or "session" cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a
            web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry
            date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser
            is closed.</p>
        <p>2.3 Cookies do not typically contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal
            information that we store about you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from
            cookies.</p>
        <p>2.4 Cookies can be used by web servers to identify and track users as they navigate different pages on a
            website and identify users returning to a website.</p>
        <ol start="3">
            <li><strong>Analytics cookies</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>3.1 We use Google Analytics to analyse the use of our website.</p>
        <p>3.2 Our analytics service provider generates statistical and other information about website use by means of
            cookies.</p>
        <p>3.3 The information generated relating to our website is used to create reports about the use of our
            website.</p>
        <p>3.4 Our analytics service provider's privacy policy is available at: [<a

            <li><strong>Third party cookies</strong></li>
        </ol>
        <p>4.1 Our website also uses third party cookies.</p>
        <p>4.2 We publish Google AdSense advertisements on our website. To determine your interests, Google will track
            your behaviour on our website and on other websites across the web using the DoubleClick cookie. This
            behaviour tracking allows Google to tailor the advertisements you see on other websites to reflect your
            interests (we do not publish interest-based advertisements on this website). You can view, delete or add
            interest categories associated with your browser by visiting: http://www.google.com/settings/ads/. You can
            also opt out of the AdSense partner network cookie using those settings or using the NAI's (Network
            Advertising Initiative's) multi-cookie opt-out mechanism at: http://www.networkadvertising.org/choices/.
            However, these opt-out mechanisms themselves use cookies, and if you clear the cookies from your browser
            your opt-out will not be maintained. To ensure that an opt-out is maintained in respect of a particular
            browser, you may wish to consider using the Google browser plug-in available at:
            https://www.google.com/settings/ads/plugin.</p>
